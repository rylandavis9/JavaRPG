# JavaRPG
Personal Java project hoping to make a game and publish this time, even if just on itch. Want it to be like old Nintendo top down RPGs. This is also an excuse to keep my Java skill from computer science class up to date and experiment with coding on Arch (very good experience so far).

May be more/random commits. I am used to vscode but now using IntelliJ. I am not used to their gitHub system yet.
